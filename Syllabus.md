## Description

_Interactive Media 1; Installation & Immersive Environments_ explores the theory and technique of interactive art and immersive environments.

What is interactivity? What does it mean to create meaningful interactive experiences? In this hands-on course, students will learn how to create interactive installations and environments. We will talk about what it means to create an interactive experience for general participants. Scale, space, and time will be explored with reference to the body, while creating cybernetic systems for real-time and time-based interaction. Software, electronics, and physical computing will be discussed, with the goal of students' creating physical projects. A variety of input and output mechanisms, networking, and best practices will be covered in lecture. Class discussions will cover readings about interactive art/music, design, space, and installation. Students are free to explore their own ideas through the lens of this course.

This course will include a mix of reading, discussion, interactive development, and projects.

## Objectives

Through this course, students are expected to;

- Illustrate an understanding about interactive art and interactive theory
- Become versed in some of the tools and techniques available for the creation of interactive installations, including;
    - real-time digital signal processing
    - data capture, including;
        - symbolic controllers (MIDI)
        - audio signals via microphones
        - physical computing (buttons, sensors, or basic electronics)
        - computer vision (edge detection, face recognition)
    - immersive environment construction
- Evaluate experience differences for various types of installations;
    - installations for one person vs. many people
    - time-dependent or input-dependent installations
- Distinguish the difference between reactive, interactive, and dynamically changing systems.
- Produce, present, and asses at least two portfolio quality works.

Students are expected to bring ideas to explore these techniques. The goals of the projects are not simply about the successful application of the technical processes. Instead, the goal is to integrate these technical elements to make work that is meaningful.

This course will conclude with an intensive collective installation project. The goal of this artistic work is to incorporate the interactive theory, art, and concepts of installation discussed during the first half of the course. The latter half of the course will be devoted to designing, composing, and building the collective installation work. This will give students a real-world experience of working in the field on an art installation or large-scale experience design.

    - Slack is a communication tool used in industry, startups, and art teams. We will use this as our primary tool of communication for the class. You are **REQUIRED** to participate in Slack and check it regularly. (I would encourage you to download the Slack app for your computer and mobile devices.)




## Pre-Requisites

There are no specific pre-req's for this course. Instead, you are expected to utilize your previous expertise in coding, content creation, story telling, art, sculpture, sound, music, dance, etc. towards the projects presented in the course.

With that being said, it is suggested that you have taken Creative Coding 1 & 2 (MART 120/220), as well as Web Development and Web Technologies (MART 341/441).

## Books and Supplies

There are no required texts that you must purchase for this course. All readings will be available to you through web links, library access to journal databases, or the class Slack channel.

### Other Supplies

You will need access to a computer capable of running modern sound and visual processing languages, digital audio workstations (DAWs), editing software, and a development environment. This computer should also be capable of real-time signal processing through analog inputs and outputs (i.e., using an audio interface or web cam). Please leverage departmental resources whenever necessary.

Additionally, you will be expected to produce projects throughout the course. This may require minimal financial investments in materials from you. I will work to keep these to a minimum, and to utilize departmental/institutional resources when possible.



# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through;

- Projects
	- There will be three larger assigned projects throughout the semester that relate to the current topics being discussed. These are the students opportunity to synthesis creative concerns and technical concerns from multiple weeks of content into singular sonic artworks.
- Project Presentation
    - At least one, but more likely two, of the projects from this semester are required to be presented publicly. These will likely occur through course organized shows.
- Project Documentation
	- Each project will require project documentation, including; a demo video, academic report describing aesthetic and technical success in relation to the larger field, and a written description.
- In-class discussions and critiques
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about technical and artistic issues.
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about outside readings, videos, and listenings.
    - You are expected to engage in class critique days of the two projects.


#### Projects

We will have three projects throughout the course that are relevant to concepts, techniques, and creative ideas from recent content. These are the students opportunity to synthesis creative concerns and technical concerns from multiple weeks of content into singular artworks.

Project grades will be based primarily on the student’s ability to:

1.  Demonstrate an understanding of the specific characteristics and integrative capabilities of the assigned topic through artistic output, written documentation, and technical achievement.
2.  Articulate a clear and concise perspective within the artwork.
3.  Present an organized artistic piece, as well as; technical report, file/program structure, and demo video.
4.  Demonstrate engagement with an iterative process of ideation → creation → presentation → assessment.
5.  Demonstrate creativity beyond the expected technical requirements.
6.  Properly and punctually deliver all assignment files.

**Please Note:** All Projects are required for this course. Failure to complete and submit a project will result in a failing grade for the course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Completion of this course requires all projects be completed.

#### Participation

This class will be participatory, and you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students. Additionally, all projects will be completed as collectives of students (i.e., groups).



## Grades

#### Final Grades

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

- Show & Tell presentations: 10%
- In-class discussions (readings & round-table feedback), critiques: 10%
- Project Sketches: 15%
- Project 1: "Create an Interactive Experience in a Space with Paper" 10%
- Project 2: "Cybernetic System as Interactive Art Installation" 25%
- Project 3: "Class Collective builds an Interactive Art Installation" 30%

Letters are assigned according to the following final course percentages:

| Grade | % Range 	|
|:-----:|:---------:|
| A  	| `[93-100]`|
| A- 	| `[90-93)`	|
| B+ 	| `[87-90)`	|
| B  	| `[83-87)`	|
| B- 	| `[80-83)`	|

| C- 	| `[70-73)`	|
| D  	| `[60-70)`	|
| F  	| `[0-60)`	|


#### Late Work

IMPORTANT: Since projects are experienced as a group in class or through a public presentation, late projects are not permissible and will not be accepted.

Documentation assignments handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one day of the due date will lose 5% for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the professor.

## Attendance

- Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class
- Critique days are mandatory. No exceptions. No tardiness.
- Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (email is preferred)
- Unexcused absences will affect your grade.
- One absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 percentage points out of 100 for each additional absence.
- You are expected to work with colleagues to catch-up on what you missed.


## Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpesa/Dean%20of%20Students/default.php):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgment. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)

- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.



## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification.




## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
